It is not a joke, it is HTTP over HTTP, a new tunnel technology. You can find many tunnel technologies, including SOCKS, SSH, VPN etc. The main idea of these tunnel technology is encryption, it encrypts information so hopefully none can decrypt it. OK, if I was the mid-man, I would block all transactions that I am unable to decrypt.

So HTTP over HTTP technology is not to keep information secret, it try to cheat the mid-man or security firewall, it hides the real destination and information to HTTP message, basically it works in this way:

client---GET google.com-->HOH-client==========GET baidu.com================>HOH-server----GET google.com----->[google]


1. Mannually build steps:
  git clone https://github.com/zhangzhongkui/http-over-http.git
  cd http-over-http/
  autoreconf -if
  ./configure --prefix=/opt/ats
  make
  make install


  cd example/thomas_https
  ./build.sh

  cd example/thomas_remap
  ./build.sh client (or server)

  On client browser, import /opt/ats/etc/trafficserver/ssl/rootCA.crt to trust CA

2. Docker iamges [recommended]
2.1 set up client end
  docker run -dit -p 9090:8080 tzhangshare/hoh-client
  docker attach [container ID]
  install /opt/ats/etc/trafficserver/rootCA.crt for your browser.
  vim /opt/ats/etc/trafficserver/plugin.config. Change the default IP[10.203.108.10]to your server end IP
  ctl+p, ctl+q to exit
  set [hoh-client IP:9090] as your browser's proxy
2.2 set up server end
  docker run -dit -p 8080:8080 -p 443:443 tzhangshare/hoh-server
